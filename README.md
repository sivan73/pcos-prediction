## About the Models
CatBoost & XGBoost: Trained on preprocessed PCOS dataset with hybrid feature selection.

Explainability: Each prediction is explained for the risk score with the major contributing factors and their weightage

Synthetic wearable data (to be added) simulates future integration with real devices.
